# English for Construction Course

##  Overview
This repository contains materials from the **English for Construction course** that I designed and delivered.  
The course was created for professionals in the construction industry, focusing on **technical vocabulary, email communication, and practical scenarios**.  

I was able to teach this course thanks to my **knowledge of construction procedures and technical drawings**, which I gained during my studies at a **Technical Secondary School in Environmental Protection**. This background allowed me to connect language learning with real-world engineering contexts.
